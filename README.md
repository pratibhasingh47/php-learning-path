# PHP Learning Path 

This is my learning path of PHP which include declaring php syntax, php variable & datatypes, built-in superglobals, php operators, conditions and control structures, arrays, built-in functions, constant and loops in php.
Create Mysql database, connect to a database, insert-update-delete in database, sessions & session-security in php and hashing in php.
