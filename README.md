# PHP Learning Path 🔷🔶🔷

This is my learning path of PHP which include declaring php syntax, php variable & datatypes, built-in superglobals, php operators, conditions and control structures, arrays, built-in functions, constant and loops in php.
Create Mysql database, connect to a database, insert-update-delete in database, sessions & session-security in php and hashing in php.

###### Note - To run all these files you need to have xampp or wamp installed in your PC or Laptops. Start your Mysql server & Apache server.
